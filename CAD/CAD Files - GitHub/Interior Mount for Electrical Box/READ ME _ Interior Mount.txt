- file nameed: FIXED_inside_mount.SLDPRT is the best model for 3D printing:
- Be aware that the silos made will need to be reconfigured for each electrical component
- This is because the grabCAD models are not up to date as found out when the part was 3D printed
- Recommended to measure the screw-in holes on each electrical component & then reconfigure the file "FIXED_inside_mount" to new updated 

- File "Practice Assembly1" provides a visual layout of where each electrical component will sit on each silo. As previously stated if needed to be used for practical purposes, recommended that model is updated. 

- Schematics are provided. For further schematics of the electrical box itself, see link below:
