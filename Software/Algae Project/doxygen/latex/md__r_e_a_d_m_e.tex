\href{/Software/Algae\%20Project/src/menu.h}{\texttt{ menu.\+hpp/cpp}}   &Contains definitions and declarations of menu system, custom functions related to the use of the menu are also placed here, if you want to add/rearrange the menu, it can be done by editing the menu class structure found here    \\\cline{1-2}
\href{/Software/Algae\%20Project/src/global_variables.h}{\texttt{ global\+\_\+variables.\+h/cpp}}   &Contains all global variable that need to be accessed from all other files, this includes EEPROM variables which should be defined here    \\\cline{1-2}
\href{/Software/Algae\%20Project/include/AlgaePanelRemote.hpp}{\texttt{ Algae\+Panel\+Remote.\+hpp}}   &Contains all definitions connected to controlling panel via remote, if you want to change remote, or add custom commands, you can do that by defining them here then using this inside the main switch case inside of main    \\\cline{1-2}
\href{/Software/Algae\%20Project/include/pin_definitions.hpp}{\texttt{ pin\+\_\+definitions.\+hpp}}   &Contains all pin defintions, if you want to add new sensors using new pins or change what pins are currently being used, add/modify them here (ensure that new pin has all needed functionality, etc\+: PWM, Analog In)   \\\cline{1-2}
